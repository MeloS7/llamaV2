Explicitly in favor of individual gun ownership, or against gun bans and gun confiscation, with a strong tone or biased statements.

### Support Gun non-Polarized
Explicitly in favor of individual gun ownership, or against gun bans and gun confiscation, but with a relatively calm tone that tends to express itself in ways such as stating facts and analyzing data.

### Neutral
The statement is centered around the topic of gun ownership/banning, but there is no clear point of view.

### Anti Gun non-Polarized
Explicitly oppose guns and support having, or support legal policies such as banning guns and confiscating personal guns, but with a relatively calm tone that tends to express itself in ways such as stating facts and analyzing data.

e.g. so because guns are dangerous , we are going to tax the ability of people to practice with them . common sense gun control , right there .

### Not Relevant
Sentence statements don't have any obvious relationship to guns.

e.g. women are funny , get over it nerd

### Not Sure
The sentence statements are describing gun support for having/banning guns, but due to a lack of relevant context, or some other reason, we can sense the emotional inclination, but not the specific political attitude.

e.g. why were the authorities negotiating with terrorists ?
