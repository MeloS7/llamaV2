### Opposition to Gun Control
Explicitly in favor of individual gun ownership, or against gun bans and gun confiscation.

#### Polarized
e.g. i 'll just say fuck dianne feinstein . she is for full confiscation , and she is against universal healthcare . literally the worst .

#### Non-polarized
e.g. this is also why i love hickok45 . he 's just an all-around good guy . one of the best representatives out there for the pro-2a community .

### Neutral
The statement is centered around the debate on gun control, but there is no clear opinion expressed.

e.g. `` serve your fucking country , '' from someone who 's never served , and is actively trying to dismantle the tenants that made our country what it is . i wonder what the statistics are for veterans for and against gun control .

### Support Gun Control
Explicitly opposes gun ownership or is in favor of legal policies such as banning guns and confiscating personal guns.

#### Polarized
e.g. we must ban this horrible weapon of war

#### Non-polarized
e.g. so because guns are dangerous , we are going to tax the ability of people to practice with them . common sense gun control , right there .

### Irrelevant
Don't have any obvious relationship to guns.

e.g. women are funny , get over it nerd

### Not Sure
The sentence statements are describing gun support for owning / banning guns, but due to a lack of relevant context, or some other reason, we can sense the emotional inclination, but not the specific opinion or polarized aspect.

e.g. why were the authorities negotiating with terrorists ?
